            Pictured to the left is the arrangement of the starting platforms for the Rumor Honeybottoms fight.
            After this 12-row sequence has scrolled beyond the screen,
            the game tries to remove one (1) platform from every subsequent row.

            The Rumor Tool allows you to generate a sequence of platforms,
            <span class="myekulColor">BeePlatforms.txt</span>,
            which can be injected into the debug mod.
            To do this, place the generated BeePlatforms.txt file in the same directory as the Cuphead executable,
            and in the debug menu, enable "<span class="myekulColor">Read Missing Platforms from file</span>" under the
            Rumor Honeybottoms RNG section.

            There are some quirks with the platform generation logic.
            Notably, there are some cases where certain platforms will not be removed.
            In short, the game tries to prevent consecutive missing platforms on the far left/right edges of the screen.
            The tool automatically applies this logic and highlights the platforms white.
            As a user of this tool, you don't need to worry about these quirks.
            Just fiddle around with the interface and see what happens.

        <div>The visual sprite references are for Regular mode,
            and they are dependent on getting a perfect police bee kill, where he only stops once.
