            The Mr. Chimes fight expects the player to match the cards to finish the level.
            The arrangement of the cards is randomized upon level entry.

            However, these card patterns are not entirely random.
            There are 12 predetermined card arrangements, and it's possible to decipher the pattern by
            looking at just 2 cards.

            Before the fight begins, the cards are revealed for around three seconds.
            Take this opportunity to identify the locations of the two MDHR crest cards.
            Determine their numeric positions on the board, counting from left to right and top to
            bottom.
            In the example on the left, the code is "7-9".

            When you determine the code, press the corresponding button.
            This will reveal the card arrangement. Good luck!
